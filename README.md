# 🛩️ Xpeero - Simple, Fast & User Friendly File Sharing platform

A small web app built with Next.js for quick, privacy-focused file transfers using short links or P2P sessions.

# Key Features

Send files via short links or rooms.

P2P transfer with WebRTC for fast, encrypted, server-free transfers.

Server-assisted fallback using socket signaling + blob storage if P2P fails.

No account required; ephemeral links and room-based sharing.

Large file handling with chunking, retries, and resumable transfers.

# How It Works

Sender selects files → generates a link or room.

Signaling: Clients exchange data via server (Socket.IO or serverless).

P2P: Files streamed via WebRTC if possible.

Fallback: Upload to server/blob store if P2P fails.

Cleanup: Ephemeral shares auto-expire.
